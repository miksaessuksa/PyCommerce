## PyCommerce

#### Context
In order to stand out from competitors, it is crucial for e-commerce companies to understand clients' pain points. Data sciences methods such as **sentiment analysis**, allow businesses to extract values from customers' feedback. Identifying areas of improvements, strenghts, and product trends represent a strong advantage to plan out deadlines and optimize decision making.
Sentiment analysis is made possible by the use of **Natural Language Processing** methods (NLP) or which consists in **understanding** and **manipulating** natural language by the machines.

Throughout this project, we analyzed clients' feedback for the **Trusted Shop** website originating from two sources: 
>- **Trusted Shop**: verified comments, meaning they result from a client order.
>- **Trustpilot**: comments from internet users.

After analyzing customers' comments, our objective was to categorize new product feedback using a binary classification (positive/negative).

Further development of this project, on a more business oriented perspective, has been to understand the reasons behind customers satisfaction or dissatisfaction. This could help the company to monitor its activity completed with additionnal key performance indicators (KPI),
tracking evolution per region of good/bad comments for each of these main categories identified.
As a consequence this would help the company to engage concrete action plan internally that would improve its operational efficiency, and in-fine its digital reputation.
In this report we already tried to serve this purpose in different ways, notably:

our work with the reviews POStagging showed that we can retrieve easily features that would allow us not only to identify more precisely customers'pain points, but also to investigate their seasonal and yearly trends/changes.
In a different approach, we also initated a mapping defining all main categories and sub-categories using Graph Theory and NetworkX library.
